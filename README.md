# Joshcoles.com
This project is built off of [Gatsby's Contentful Starter project](https://github.com/contentful-userland/gatsby-contentful-starter), and is an updated version of [my original portfolio website](https://github.com/joshcoles/joshcoles-dot-com), which was a largely static React.js site. 

This updated version is built using Contentful, Gatsby, GraphQL and Netlify.

## Crucial Commands

### `npm run dev`

Run the project locally with live reload in development mode.

### `npm run build`

Run a production build into `./public`. The result is ready to be put on any static hosting you prefer.

### `npm run serve`

Spin up a production-ready server with your blog. Don't forget to build your page beforehand.
